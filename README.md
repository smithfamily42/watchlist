# Watchlist

# Description:
We have made an app to select then organize movies and shows that you plan to watch.

Motivation for development?

We have all been in the unfortunate situation where we spend precious time looking for online entertainment, with Watchlist this problem is no more! This app takes care of lazy bingers problem by providing a way for watchers to organize and store their must watch lists. 

# User story:
As a user/entertainment enjoyer I would like an app that would provide movies and tv shows for me to select from so that I can build a complete and detailed watchlist to later choose from. 

# Functionality and Features:
After creating an account and logging in, a user will be presented with featured movies and shows on the homepage. After navigating to their "mylists" page, they'll have the ability to add movies and shows to their own lists. Their own personal picks will be readily available to them when they feel the need to binge. 


# Technologies:

This app runs in the browser and features:

- JavaScript 
- RESTful APIs databases 
- Object-relational mapping
- Environment variables 
- Templating 
- Authentication 
- Handlebarsjs 
- Bootstrap library 
- Animate CSS library
